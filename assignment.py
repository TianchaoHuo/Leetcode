    4-connectivity method that only North and West neighbours of the current pixel, we then merge the
    equivalent label using the EquivalentLabelPairs.

    The algorithm is :

            If the element is not the background
            Get the neighboring elements of the current element
            If there are no neighbors, uniquely label the current element and continue
            Otherwise, find the neighbor with the smallest label and assign it to the current element
            Store the equivalence between neighboring labels
        On the second pass:

            Iterate through each element of the data by column, then by row
            If the element is not the background
            Relabel the element with the lowest equivalent label
